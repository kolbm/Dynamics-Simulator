# Dynamics Simulator
This Python program, developed using Streamlit, is designed for high school students to simulate the motion of an object under constant acceleration. The user-friendly web interface allows students to input parameters such as initial velocity, acceleration, time step, and total time for the simulation. Upon running the simulation, the program calculates and displays the object's position, velocity, and acceleration at different time intervals in both a table and a visual plot (position vs. time). Students can download the simulation data as a CSV file for further analysis. The program is easily accessible via a web browser on Chromebooks, requiring no prior programming knowledge to operate.
